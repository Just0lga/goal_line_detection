A sophisticated web application that uses AI computer vision to detect when a ball crosses the goal line in football/soccer videos. The system provides frame-level precision and generates annotated videos with detected goal events.

## Features

ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate Detection**: Uses advanced AI models (YOLO/Detectron2) to detect balls, goal posts, and goal lines
ðŸ“¹ **Video Processing**: Processes entire videos frame-by-frame with real-time annotations
ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive web interface with drag-and-drop video upload
ðŸ“Š **Detailed Results**: Frame-by-frame analysis with timestamps and confidence scores
ðŸ’¾ **Download Results**: Get annotated videos and detailed JSON reports
ðŸš€ **Dual AI Support**: Choose between YOLO (fast) or Detectron2 (accurate) detection

## Architecture

The application consists of several key components:

### 1. Backend (Flask)
- **app.py**: Main Flask application with video upload and processing endpoints
- **detectron2_detector.py**: Advanced detector using your trained Detectron2 model
- **GoalLineDetector class**: YOLO-based detector with Hough line detection

### 2. Frontend
- **templates/index.html**: Modern, responsive web interface
- Real-time progress tracking
- Interactive results display
- Video preview and download

### 3. AI Models
- **YOLO Detection**: Fast object detection for balls
- **Detectron2 Detection**: Instance segmentation for balls, posts, and lines
- **OpenCV Processing**: Line detection and geometric analysis

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": {
    "original_file": "video.mp4",
    "processed_file": "processed_video.mp4",
    "goal_events": [...],
    "total_goals": 2,
    "detector_used": "Detectron2"
  },
  "processed_video_url": "/results/processed_video.mp4"
}
```

### GET /results/{filename}

## Detection Algorithm

### YOLO Detector
1. **Ball Detection**: Uses YOLO model to detect soccer balls
2. **Line Detection**: Canny edge detection + Hough transform for goal line
3. **Goal Event**: Triggered when ball is within 5% of frame height from goal line

### Detectron2 Detector (Advanced)
1. **Object Detection**: Detects balls, goal posts, and lines using instance segmentation
2. **Line Extraction**: Extracts precise goal line from segmentation masks
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Advanced geometric analysis for accurate goal detection
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor confidence calculation

## Configuration

### Model Paths
- YOLO model (primary): `../goal-seg/exp3050ti2/weights/best.pt` (your custom trained model)
- YOLO model (fallback): `../yolo11n.pt` (alternative model)
- Detectron2 model: `../output/model_final.pth` (your trained model)

### Detection Parameters
```python
# Confidence thresholds
BALL_CONFIDENCE = 0.5
LINE_CONFIDENCE = 0.5

# Goal line proximity threshold (% of frame height)
GOAL_THRESHOLD = 0.05

# Line detection parameters
CANNY_LOW = 50
CANNY_HIGH = 150
HOUGH_THRESHOLD = 100
```

## Performance Optimization

### For Better Results:
1. **Use trained models**: Place your trained YOLO/Detectron2 models in the correct paths
2. **GPU acceleration**: Ensure CUDA is available for faster processing
3. **Video quality**: Higher resolution videos generally give better detection results
4. **Lighting conditions**: Well-lit videos with clear goal lines work best

### Processing Speed:
- **YOLO**: ~30-60 FPS (depending on hardware)
- **Detectron2**: ~5-15 FPS (more accurate but slower)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No module named 'detectron2'"**
   - Install Detectron2 following the installation instructions above
   - The app will fall back to YOLO if Detectron2 is not available

2. **"CUDA out of memory"**
   - Reduce video resolution or use CPU processing
   - Set `cfg.MODEL.DEVICE = "cpu"` in detectron2_detector.py

3. **Poor detection accuracy**
   - Ensure you're using your trained models (not the fallback pre-trained ones)
   - Adjust confidence thresholds in the detector classes
   - Check video quality and lighting conditions

4. **Slow processing**
   - Use YOLO detector for faster processing
   - Enable GPU acceleration
   - Consider processing shorter video clips
